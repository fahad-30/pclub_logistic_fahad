- Move to *Cell 4* to mess around with control varibales
    - Learning rate (*default = 0.00001*)
    - \# of Epochs (*default = 5000*)
- *Cell 5*: contains the prediction model
- *Cell 6*: Accuracy calculations
- *Cell 7 the final one*: Plotted the graph   at each and every 100<sup>th</sup> epoch for:
    -  Epochs vs Error, and
    -  Epochs vs Accuracy
